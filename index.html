        <h3>About PetVenture</h3>
        <p class="mission-statement">At PetVenture, we strongly believe that our pets deserve to experience all that the world has to offer. That's why we make it our mission to curate pet-friendly travel experiences for our clients and their furry BFFs.</p>
        <h4>What We Do</h4>
        <p>PetVenture works with clients to plan out 100% pet-friendly vacations, inclusive of travel, lodging, restaraunts, and activities. We handle all the booking for you and are available at a moment's notice if something in your itinerary needs to be altered during your trip.</p>
        <h4>How It Works</h4>
        <p><a href="#get-started">Fill out the registration form</a> below to get started. Once you have entered all the required information, we will reach out to schedule a brief call to work out what type of vacation or trip you are looking to plan. From there, PetVenture will curate an itinerary. This is an interactive process, where we will work with you each step of the way. </p>
        <h4>Our History</h4>
        <p>PetVenture was founded by Jane and John Doe in 2021, who wanted to provide a service for everyone that they saw was missing from the travel industry: pet-friendly travel planning. But prior to that, the idea of PetVenture started as a personal dream to be able to bring their two beloved dogs, Archie and Beau on vacation with them as much as possible and be able to do more than just hike with them. Jane and John have been planning pet-friendly adventures for their clients for two years now and have made tons of happy memories along the way.</p>

        <h3>What our clients are saying</h3>
        <div class="quotes">
            <p>"We're so glad we used PetVenture to plan our most recent vacation! Buddy was able to accompany us every step of the way!" - Christine & Thomas"</p>
            <p>"PetVenture is the first of it's kind in Pet-friendly travel. I was able to take my cat, Bingo, abroad with me (at a very reasonable price). We made unforgettable memories together. It is a trip I will always cherish. Thank you, PetVenture!" - Rebecca</p>
            <p>"We wanted a family vacation that included the WHOLE family, including our 5 year old Golden Retriever, Sammy. We were able to take Sammy into restaraunts, shops, and even the hotel room with us. We would've never found so many pet-friendly establishments on our own. We will definitely be using PetVenture to plan our next trip!" - The Smiths</p>
